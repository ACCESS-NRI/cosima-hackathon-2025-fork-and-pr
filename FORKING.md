# Forking the repository

### What is forking?

Forking is a way of telling GitHub "create a carbon copy of this repository, so that I own the copy". People might do this for lots of reasons - one of them being to take someone elses work, and do something new and different with it. Much like a fork in the road, this could then take the code down a new path - which is why we call it forking. 

When you fork a repository, you can also use a Pull Request to contribute it back to the original repository - which is what we're going to do today.

#### How do I fork a repository

This should then send you to a page like this:

Hit Create Fork - you can change the name and description if you like - before redirecting you to a page like this:
