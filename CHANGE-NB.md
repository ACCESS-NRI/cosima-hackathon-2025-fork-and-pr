# Pushing changes to Jupyter notebooks

COSIMA Recipes predominately contains Jupyter Notebooks. These are great for interacting with scripts, looking at plots, etc., but contain a lot more than just code in them. 

This demo is just to show you that when you edit a Jupyter notebook, the changes can be a little more confusing.

Now, take a look at [demo_notebook.ipynb](demo_notebook.ipynb).

We're going to:
1. Create a new branch.
2. Make the changes suggested in the notebook.
3. Run it.
4. Add, commit and push our changes.
5. Create a pull request.

How does this look different to just adding your name to this document? What's the same?


### ReviewNB

Luckily, cosima-recipes uses a tool called [ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com/) so you can easily look at the changes - but it's worth being aware that more can change than just the code!
