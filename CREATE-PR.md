# Creating a Pull Request

From our previous commit, we can see this line:
```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin add-name-to-contributors
...
remote: Create a pull request for 'add-name-to-contributors' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/charles-turner-1/cosima-hackathon-2025-fork-and-pr/pull/new/add-name-to-contributors
...
```

Lets follow that link to make our pull request! Click on it, and it should take you to something like this:

All we need to do now is add a useful description, and then click Create Pull Request:

Once you've done this, your Pull Request should be visible [here](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/cosima-hackathon-2025-fork-and-pr/pulls)! That's it!
